=== PDF SUBMISSION TEXT ===
1. A Kubernetes Service is a stable endpoint that exposes a set of Pods. Since Pods
can restart and change IPs, the Service gives a consistent way to reach them using a
virtual IP and DNS name. It also load-balances tra(cid:431)ic across matching Pods.
2. ClusterIP is only reachable inside the cluster, mainly for internal communication.
NodePort exposes the service on a port of every node so it can be accessed from
outside.
3. NetworkPolicy is useful when you want only the backend pods to accept tra(cid:431)ic from
the frontend pods, and block all other pods in the namespace.
